# RISC-V Vector Intrinsic Document

Working draft for the RISC-V vector specification are under [doc/](doc/), intrinsic prototypes under
[auto-generated/](auto-generated/) are generated by scripts under [rvv-intrinsic-generator/](rvv-intrinsic-generator/).

Please check out the latest intrinsics specification under
[Releases](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/releases).

Upcoming LLVM 17 and GCC trunk supports [v0.12](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/releases/tag/v0.12.0), which is
expected to be identical to the to-be-frozen intrinsic specification.

[Clang 16](https://releases.llvm.org/16.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) and
[GCC 13](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/changes.html) supports the
[v0.11](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/releases/tag/v0.11.1) version, which does not have tuple type
segment load/store intrinsics, fixed-point intrinsics with rounding mode parameter, and floating-point intrinsics
with rounding mdoe parameter.
