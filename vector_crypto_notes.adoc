= Note for vector crypto intrinsics

== Availability of vector crypto intrinsics

Availability for the vector crypto instruction intrinsics will depend on the minimum vector length specified in the architecture via the `Zvl*b` ^0^ sub-extension. Vector length is required to be at least one EGW (element group width ^1^) long.

Take the intrinsic of `vaesdf.vs` as an example. Given that the instruction will compute with a single element group provided from `vs2`, `vuint32mf2_t` of must be at least 128 bits long. Therefore the intrinsic requires `zvl256b` to be available.

```
vuint32m4_t __riscv_vaesdf_vs_u32m4 (vuint32m4_t vd, vuint32mf2_t vs2, size_t vl);
```
