= Version Macro

The `__riscv_v_intrinsic` macro is the test macro to checking the availability and version the compiler supports for the RISC-V V C intrinsic API.

The value of architecture extension test macro are defined as its version, which is compute by the following formula:

```
<MAJOR_VERSION> * 1,000,000 + <MINOR_VERSION> * 1,000 + <REVISION_VERSION>
```

For example, the v0.10 version should define the macro with value `10000`.
